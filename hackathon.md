### Section 1: Problem & User

**Target Users:** University students and early-career professionals (0-5 years experience) seeking jobs worldwide.

**Pain Points:** (1) **Application chaos**: Job seekers apply to 50-200+ positions across multiple platforms, losing track of stages, deadlines, and follow-ups (2) **Generic materials**: Using identical resumes/cover letters for every job leads to ATS rejection and low response rates (3) **Poor preparation**: Scattered resources (YouTube tips, random practice questions) with no structured, job-specific interview practice (4) **No feedback loop**: Can't identify what's working or improve systematically

**Importance & Urgency:** 75% of resumes never reach human reviewers due to poor ATS optimization. Average job search takes 3-6 months with 100+ applications. Missed deadlines = lost opportunities in competitive markets. Interview performance makes or breaks candidacy - one shot to impress

Job hunting is a full-time project requiring organization, personalization, and practice. Current tools either track applications OR help prepare, never both. Candidates need a unified command center that manages the chaos while leveraging AI to compete effectively.
